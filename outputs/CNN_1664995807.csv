2022-10-05,CNN,"SpaceX, NASA launch 3 astronauts and 1 cosmonaut to the ISS. Here’s everything you need to know",Jackie Wattles,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/world/spacex-nasa-crew-5-astronaut-launch-scn/index.html," SpaceX and NASA launched a crew of astronauts who hail from all over the world on a trip to the International Space Station Wednesday. The mission, which includes some historic firsts, moved forward even as rising geopolitical tensions brew on the ground. The four crew members — astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada of NASA, astronaut Koichi Wakata of JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and cosmonaut Anna Kikina of Roscosmos — took off aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft at 12 p.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After reaching orbit, NASA shared footage of the crew aboard their capsule, sharing their excitement as they explained that they brought along a “freefall indicator” — a small, stuffed doll in the likeness of Albert Einstein. The toy was left to float around the cabin, signaling that the crew had entered weightlessness. Einstein, who first conceptualized the Theory of Relativity, had the “happiest thought of his entire life” when he realized that a “person in freefall can feel their own weight,” Cassada explained in a dispatch from the Crew Dragon spacecraft. “We live in the same world, we live in the same universe. Sometimes we experience it in a very different way from our neighbors. We can all keep that in mind … and continue to do amazing things,” Cassada said, and Kikina could be seen pumping her fist as he spoke. “And do it together.” Dubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station. The spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann not only became the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. She’s also serving as mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission. What’s more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist — at least for now. The Crew Dragon spacecraft is now on a slow, precise trek to the ISS, which orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. ET. Launching NASA astronauts to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is nothing new. The space agency collaborated with SpaceX for years to transition the task of shuttling people to and from the space station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011. With the return of astronaut launches from US soil, SpaceX has offered a stage for several historic firsts. The Crew-4 Dragon mission, for example, carried NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, the first Black woman ever to join the ISS crew. On this flight, Mann, a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley Reservation, became the first Native American woman ever to travel to orbit. “I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,” Mann told reporters before launch. “I think it’s important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have.” In her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple of women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program. Kikina, the Roscosmos cosmonaut, became the first Russian ever to launch on a SpaceX vehicle at a time when US-Russian relations are hitting near fever pitch over the Ukraine war. Officials at NASA have said repeatedly that joint operations with Russia on the ISS, where the two countries are the primary operators, will remain isolated from the fray. Kikina’s flight comes just weeks after NASA’s Dr. Frank Rubio launched to the ISS aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz capsule. “I really love my crewmates,” Kikina told reporters after she arrived at the Florida launch site on Saturday. “I really feel good, comfortable. … We will do our job the best way: happy.” During a post-launch news conference, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership. “We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,” Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meet up in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the United States and Russia. “Now we continue that.” READ MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream Mann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his “closest friends on the planet.” As with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina. For veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA’s space shuttle and Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission. “I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,” he recalled during an August press conference. “It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home.” After reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts. There will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-4 mission back home. Then the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station’s exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments. “Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,” according to NASA. Crew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months."
2022-10-05,CNN,Soccer lexicon: ‘Squeaky bum time’ and ‘park the bus’ added to Oxford English Dictionary,Alasdair Howorth,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/football/alex-ferguson-jose-mourinho-english-dictionary-spt-intl/index.html," Soccer’s lexicon is a rich reservoir of often curiously contorted cliche and phrasing, frequently the subject of parody. Now, the linguistic ingenuity of two of the most influential coaches in modern football – Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho – have been officially recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Ferguson’s phrase “squeaky bum time” and Mourinho’s “park the bus” comment were two of 15 football-themed OED additions ahead of the World Cup in Qatar later this year. “While the OED already covered a large number of football terms, from catenaccio to nutmeg to water carrier, this select batch of additions fills a few gaps in our formation,” the dictionary said in a statement. The term “squeaky bum time” originated in a 2003 media conference when Ferguson was looking to heap pressure on Manchester United’s English Premier League rival Arsenal. “They have a replay against Chelsea and if they win it they would face a semifinal three days before playing us in the league,” said Ferguson. “But then they did say they were going to win the treble, didn’t they? It’s squeaky bum time and we’ve got the experience now to cope.” The OED defines Ferguson’s phrase as a “a reference to the sound of someone shifting restlessly on plastic seating during tense closing stages of a contest.” Current AS Roma coach Mourinho, who is famed for his influence on British culture – including a cameo appearance in English rapper and singer Stormzy’s latest music video – has also made the OED cut. The OED’s definition of the former Chelsea manager’s “park the bus” is “to play in a very defensive way, typically by having the majority of outfield players close to their own goal and showing little attacking intent.” “As we say in Portugal, they brought the bus and they left the bus in front of the goal,” Mourinho said after Chelsea’s 0-0 draw against Tottenham in 2004. “I would have been frustrated if I had been a supporter who paid £50 [around $56] to watch this game because Spurs came to defend. I’m really frustrated because there was only one team looking to win, they only came not to concede. It’s not fair for the football we played.” Some of the other football-related OED entries are: “Total Football” (a brand of attacking, possession-based football often credited to the Netherlands), “Row Z” (the furthest seat from the sideline in a stadium), “False No. 9” (a player who starts in the striker position but drops deeper in the field) and “Trequartista” (an Italian expression describing a player who plays in the spaces between the midfield and strikers)."
2022-10-05,CNN,Greenpeace campaigners disrupt Liz Truss’s party conference speech,"Peter Wilkinson, Chris Liakos",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/uk/liz-truss-greenpeace-conservative-conference-gbr-intl/index.html," Protesters from the environmental group Greenpeace were ejected from the Conservative Party conference on Wednesday after disrupting British Prime Minister Liz Truss’s first speech as leader. Two female activists held up a flag that read “Who voted for this?” before they were escorted out of the conference center in Birmingham by security guards as the crowd booed. “Let’s get them removed,” said Truss, to applause. Truss quipped following their removal that the “anti-growth coalition” had arrived at the hall “a bit too early.” Greenpeace confirmed that its activists were responsible for the protest. In a tweet, the group said activists were there to “denounce the Prime Minister ‘shredding’ her party’s 2019 manifesto promises.” “The PM is U-turning on fracking, strong climate action, and world-leading environmental protections. Who voted for this?” The conference was taking place amid open party dissent following a screeching U-turn on Monday over a proposal to cut the top rate of UK income tax – an announcement that sent the pound to historic lows and sparked market chaos. The move was seen as insensitively helping the rich at the same time as Britons are living through the worst cost-of-living crisis for decades. Truss, who became prime minister one month ago to the day after succeeding Boris Johnson, started off her speech by saying the country is in a new era dealing with a global economic crisis and that “in these tough times, we need to step up.” “We gather at a vital time for the UK,” she said adding that “these are stormy days.” “We’re dealing with the global economic crisis caused by Covid and by Putin’s appalling war in Ukraine. In these tough times, we need to step up,” she also said. “I am determined to get Britain moving,” she added and “to put us on a strongest footing as a nation.” Truss criticized the “anti-growth coalition” that included “some of the people we had in the hall earlier.” She added: “Economic growth makes us strong at home and strong abroad and we need an economically sound and secure United Kingdom and that will mean challenging those who try to stop growth.” The prime minister was giving her speech as Conservative members of parliament voiced fears the combination of tax cuts along with huge public spending to help people cope with energy bills, rising inflation, rising interest rates and a falling pound are going to make winning the next general election impossible. “I will not allow the anti-growth coalition to hold us back,” Truss said. “Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier. “The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions. “They taxi from north London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo. “From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.” Truss walked on to the conference stage to the music of 1990s hit, “Moving on Up,” by M People. Later, the group’s founder Mike Pickering tweeted his opposition to the use of the song by the Conservatives. “So apparently we can’t stop Truss walking out to our song, very weird! So sad it got used by this shower of a government,” he wrote."
2022-10-05,CNN,Sanibel Island residents return to see if their homes survived devastating Hurricane Ian,"Nouran Salahieh, Dakin Andone",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/hurricane-ian-florida-recovery-wednesday/index.html," Residents of Florida’s Sanibel Island are warned they could be shocked when they return by boat Wednesday to their hard-hit community to set eyes for the first time on the devastation wrought a week ago by Hurricane Ian whose damage zone President Joe Biden is also due to visit today. “It is going to be emotional when they see their properties up close and the amount of damage that this storm inflicted upon them,” City Manager Dana Souza told CNN of how residents and business owners may react on Sanibel Island, where Ian wiped out parts of the causeway, severing its connection to the mainland. The opening of Sanibel to residents comes the same day President Joe Biden is visiting Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, is also being briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES At least 110 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 105 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. And it’s not clear how many people are still missing as officials work to compile a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday. More than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged. Statewide, about 290,000 customers still have no power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties. Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care, and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas. As Sanibel Island residents access their properties, the area is still “extremely unsafe,” Mayor Holly Smith said. And houses that look fine from the outside may prove to be too damaged to live in. But Dan and Tony Tabor were lucky. The couple returned to their Sanibel home prepared for the worst, with water, bleach and drywall cutters in tow to begin the rebuilding process. Instead, they found it practically untouched by the storm, with the screens on their porch still in place and plants left outside still upright. If they wanted to, they said, they could spend tonight in the home. “We are so happy,” Tony Tabor said, but “I feel so guilty, because our neighbors have seen so much damage to their houses.” Meanwhile, it could be some time before hundreds of residents of Naples, in Collier County, can get back in their homes, City Manager Jay Boodheshwar, told CNN. “There was a significant amount of homes, in fact, an entire neighborhood was submerged at least with 3 feet of water. Some areas got 6 to 7 feet of water,” Boodheshwar said. “I would guess it’s probably hundreds of households that are going to be experiencing a period of time when they’re not going to be able to be in their homes.” Many homes in the once-tranquil community on Sanibel Island “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe has said. “There are places off their foundation, and it’s very dangerous out there,” he said previously. “There are alligators running around, and there are snakes all over the place.” Most of the electrical poles and transmission lines remain down, along with wastewater systems, Souza said. “Without those necessary infrastructure, it is difficult to sustain a community of 7,000 people year around,” Souza added. “It will be some time before we can resume normal life on Sanibel,” he said. The island’s year-round population is about 7,000 people, growing to 35,000 during the high season that typically would begin in about a month, Souza said. But it could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said. DeSantis directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway. “Access to our barrier islands is a priority for our first responders and emergency services who have been working day and night to bring relief to all Floridians affected by Hurricane Ian,” he said in a statement. Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, Gov. DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm. At Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property. “In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.” “But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.” Employee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said. But some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky. “Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.” In Charlotte County, north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said. Florida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water. “We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health. Many areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes. Residents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release. Jessica Hernstadt, a resident of Fort Myers Beach in Lee County, said the community “looked like an apocalyptic disaster” when she made her way there after Ian slammed the shore, with cars, pots, pans and clothing littering the area. Homes the storm tore from their foundations blocked the streets leading to her house, which she found ablaze when she arrived, she told CNN in an interview Wednesday. Later, combing through the ashes, Hernstadt found just one item unscathed: a candlestick holder her great-grandmother carried in her pockets as she emigrated from Poland to the US. “It was the simplest, most prized possession that I had, and it gave me a sense of hope, especially today being Yom Kippur,” she said Wednesday, the holiest day of the year in Judaism. “We will survive. Our town will survive, and there’s hope to rebuild.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,Search continues for abducted California family as relatives appeal for public’s help in finding them,"Aya Elamroussi, Natasha Chen, Jack Hannah",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/california-family-missing-wednesday/index.html," The search for a family of four kidnapped in California continues Wednesday as relatives appealed for the public’s help. Authorities said they have a person of interest in custody and held a news conference in which they showed surveillance video of the family being forced into a truck by an armed man. The kidnapping of 8-month-old Aroohi Dheri, her parents Jasleen Kaur and Jasdeep Singh and the child’s uncle Amandeep Singh occurred on Monday in Merced, California. “Every store, gas stations, everybody who has cameras please check the cameras,” Sukhdeep Singh, a brother of one of the victims, told reporters Wednesday. “We need the public’s help right now. Please help us … so my family comes home safe.” Another relative, identified only as Balvinder, described the family as “peace loving” and said they own a small business and has lived in the area a long time. “We are devastated. We are shocked. We are dying every moment not finding any clues,” Balvinder said. Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke said the man in custody was convicted in 2005 in a case involving armed robbery and false imprisonment. The man was paroled in 2015. Warnke said the man acted alone in the previous case, and knew the victims. The man, who attempted to take his life, was sedated because he has been violent at the hospital. “We’ve got to get this person into a position where we can start asking questions and hopefully get some answers,” the sheriff said. “Right now, the big question and the first question that’s asked is, ‘Where’s the family?’” he added. According to the Merced County Sheriff’s Office, the investigation began Monday at 11:39 a.m., when the California Highway Patrol responded to a 2020 Dodge Ram that was on fire and asked the Merced Police Department to help track down the vehicle’s owner. =Roughly an hour later, at 12:35 p.m., Merced police officers arrived at the truck owner’s address and met with a family member there. Officers tried to contact the couple and the child’s uncle, but they were not able to reach them. Later Monday, at 1:04 p.m., officers with the Merced County Sheriff’s Office responded to a business on South Highway 59. “During the primary investigation, Detectives determined that the individuals were kidnapped,” the sheriff’s office stated Tuesday. The kidnapping involved a gun and restraints, according to Deputy Alexandra Britton, public information officer for the sheriff’s office. A suspect was seen on surveillance video at a business putting two men into a truck, followed by a woman and a baby, Britton said. In an initial statement about the case Monday, the sheriff’s office said it believed the family was taken “against their will” from a business in the 800 block of South Highway 59 in Merced, which sits between Modesto and Fresno in central California. “We have no motivation behind it. We just know they are gone,” Warnke said in a video message posted on Facebook. Warnke also said investigators collected evidence that indicates “the individuals involved in this destroyed evidence in an attempt to cover up their tracks.” On Tuesday, authorities took a 48-year-old man into custody as a person of interest in the case. Britton said the man’s family had contacted law enforcement and told them the man admitted being involved in the kidnapping. Law enforcement made contact with the man after the family’s call. As they investigate, the Merced County Sheriff’s Office continues to ask the public to contact its office at 209-385-7547 to share any information they may have regarding the case. The FBI and the California justice department are also investigating. “Investigators continue to follow up on all leads and are working diligently to find the family,” the sheriff’s office said Tuesday. Investigators learned Tuesday morning that an ATM card belonging to one of the victims was used at a bank in Atwater, California, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Atwater is about nine miles northwest of Merced. Britton said it is unclear whether the 48-year-old in custody is the person who used that card. After that transaction, investigators were able to identify the 48-year-old man as a person of interest in the case and later took him into custody, officials said. The man tried to take his life before law enforcement involvement, and he was in critical condition Tuesday, according to the sheriff’s office. Authorities were working to confirm the man in custody is the same suspect they released photos of Monday, Alexandra Britton, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, told CNN. “Investigators obtained the surveillance photo of a subject making a bank transaction where the person is similar in appearance to the surveillance photo from the original kidnapping scene,” the sheriff’s office said. On Monday, officials described the suspect as a man with a shaved head and was last seen wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He was considered armed and dangerous, officials said."
2022-10-05,CNN,"Aaron Judge’s 62nd home run ball is valued in the region of $1-2 million, experts say",George Ramsay,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/sport/home-run-ball-value-aaron-judge-spt-intl/index.html," As Aaron Judge hit his record-breaking 62nd home run, one fan struck the jackpot. The New York Yankees slugger moved clear of Roger Maris’ single-season American League record with his 62nd home run Tuesday, and Cory Youmans – sitting in left field with a front-row seat – was the lucky fan who caught the historic souvenir at Globe Life Field. A Dallas resident and Texas Rangers fan, Youmans said he doesn’t know yet whether he’ll keep the ball, and after making the catch – an event that prompted euphoric celebrations – he was escorted from the section of seats by security. Should Youmans sell the ball, he could be set for a handsome payday. “In the last week or so, our colleagues at Memory Lane auction house have guaranteed to pay the person who catches the ball $2 million,” Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President of RR Auction, told CNN. “With all the publicity and excitement, plus the fact that it’s Aaron Judge of the Yankees, I wouldn’t be surprised if another auction house or sports investment group purchases the ball for $5 million in the current environment of the sports memorabilia market. “Assuming that Judge doesn’t play tonight [against the Rangers], this ball will live forever in New York Yankee lore.” However, Ken Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions, calls the $2 million price tag a “drastic overpay” and “more of a publicity stunt,” instead valuing the ball at $1.25 million. “It’s a historic achievement that is boosted by the fact he is a loved player and plays for the New York Yankees,” Goldin told CNN, adding that $1.25 million would make this the second most expensive baseball ever sold. In 1999, Mark McGwire’s 70th home run baseball fetched $3 million at auction including commission, at the time making it the most money ever paid for a sports artifact. David Hunt, president of Hunt Auctions, agrees that higher valuations are used as a tool to generate “branding and media coverage” for auctions houses and that Judge’s 62nd home run ball is “more of a $500,000 to $1 million item from an estimated standpoint.” “But to be clear,” Hunt told CNN, “I certainly could see a path where it would bring a million or maybe even two if the proper bidders got involved. That’s not impossible.” In a statement sent to CNN, Lelands auction house called Judge’s 62nd home run ball “the most valuable baseball hit in recent years … estimated to fetch over seven figures.” “It’s just incredible that a $20 baseball can turn into a seven figure ball with one crack of the bat,” the statement added. When Judge tied Maris’ record with his 61st home run last week, no fans were able to catch the ball as it fell into the bullpen and was eventually passed along to Judge, who then gave it to his mother. Michael Kessler, the 20-year-old fan who caught Judge’s 60th home run, exchanged the ball for a clubhouse meet-and-greet with the Yankees slugger, four signed baseballs and a signed game bat, according to MLB.com. “I don’t know where it’s at,” Judge told reporters when asked about the fate of his 62nd home run ball. “We’ll see what happens with that. It’d be great to get it back but that’s a souvenir for a fan. They made a great catch out there and they’ve got every right to it.” Since breaking Maris’ 61-year-old record with his 391-feet drive in the first inning of Tuesday’s game against the Rangers, Judge has received widespread praise – including from President Joe Biden. “Congrats @TheJudge44 on home run 62. History made, more history to make,” Biden wrote on Twitter. Barry Bonds holds the major league single-season record of 73 home runs, but many have cast doubt on that landmark given he – along with other players of that era – was embroiled in performance-enhancing drug scandals and allegedly used steroids. Bonds has denied those allegations. While it remains unclear whether Judge will play Wednesday in the final game of the regular season, he has an outside chance of winning the American League triple crown by leading the circuit in batting average, runs batted in and home runs. He is first in home runs and RBIs but trails Minnesota Twins star Luis Arráez in batting average. If Judge does play on Wednesday and hits another home run, that would likely alter the value of Tuesday night’s ball. “It’s not his final home run ball, it’s not the one that established a new record and thus it’s not nearly as viable,” Hunt explained. But there’s also a scenario whereby Youmans’ catch only increases in value. “If we go another 15, 20, 30 years and nobody breaks that record, this could end up being a very, very special, historic piece, which would point towards a higher value range,” said Hunt."
2022-10-05,CNN,The bond market is crumbling. That’s bad for Wall Street and Main Street,Nicole Goodkind,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/investing/premarket-trading-stocks/index.html," The global bond market is having a historically awful year. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond, a proxy for borrowing costs, briefly moved above 4% on Wednesday for the first time in 12 years. That’s a bad omen for Wall Street and Main Street. What’s happening: This hasn’t been a pretty year for US stocks. All three major indexes are in a bear market, down more than 20% from recent highs, and analysts predict more pain ahead. When things are this bad, investors seek safety in Treasury bonds, which have low returns but are also considered low-risk (As loans to the US government, Treasury notes are seen as a safe bet since there is little risk they won’t be paid back). But in 2022’s topsy-turvy economy, even that safe haven has become somewhat treacherous. Bond returns, or yields, rise as their prices fall. Under normal market conditions, a rising yield should mean that there’s less demand for bonds because investors would rather put their money into higher-risk (and higher-reward) stocks. Instead markets are plummeting, and investors are flocking out of risky stocks, but yields are going up. What gives? Blame the Fed. Persistent inflation has led the Federal Reserve to fight back by aggressively hiking interest rates, and as a result the yields on US Treasury bonds have soared. Economic turmoil in the United Kingdom and European Union has also caused the value of both the British pound and the euro to fall dramatically when compared to the US dollar. Dollar strength typically coincides with higher bond rates as well. So while we’d normally see a rising 10-year yield as a signal that US investors have a rosy economic outlook, that isn’t the case this time. Gloomy investors are predicting more interest rate hikes and a higher chance of recession. What it means: Portfolios are aching. Vanguard’s $514.5 billion Total Bond Market Index, the largest US bond fund, is down more than 15% so far this year. That puts it on track for its worst year since it was created in 1986. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury bond fund                            (TLT) (TLT) is down nearly 30% for the year. Stock investors are also nervously eyeing Treasuries. High yields make it more expensive for companies to borrow money, and that extra cost could lower earnings expectations. Companies with significant debt levels may not be able to afford higher financing costs at all. Main Street doesn’t get a break, either. An elevated 10-year Treasury return means more expensive loans on cars, credit cards and even student debt. It also means higher mortgage rates: The spike has already helped push the average rate for a 30-year mortgage above 6% for the first time since 2008. Going deeper: Still, investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term. That’s spurred an inverted yield curve – when interest rates on short-term bonds move higher than those on long-term bonds. The inverted yield curve is a particularly ominous warning sign that has correctly predicted almost every recession over the past 60 years. The curve first inverted in April, and then again this summer. The two-year treasury yield has soared in the last week, and now hovers above 4.3%, deepening that gap. On Monday, a team at BNP Paribas predicted that the inverted gap between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields could grow to its largest level since the early 1980s. Those years were marked by sticky inflation, interest rates near 20% and a very deep recession. What’s next: The bond market may face fresh volatility on Friday with the release of the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index for August. If the report comes in above expectations, expect bond yields to move even higher. The Bank of England held an emergency intervention to maintain economic stability in the UK on Wednesday. The central bank said it would buy long-dated UK government bonds “on whatever scale is necessary” to prevent a market crash. Investors around the globe have been dumping the British pound and UK bonds since the government on Friday unveiled a huge package of tax cuts, spending and increased borrowing aimed at getting the economy moving and protecting households and businesses from sky-high energy bills this winter, reports my colleague Mark Thompson. Markets fear the plan will drive up already persistent inflation, forcing the Bank of England to push interest rates as high as 6% next spring, from 2.25% at present. Mortgage markets have been in turmoil all week as lenders have struggled to price their loans. Hundreds of products have been withdrawn. “This repricing [of UK assets] has become more significant in the past day — and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt,” the central bank said in its statement. “Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.” Many final salary, or defined-benefit, pension funds were particularly exposed to the dramatic sell-off in longer dated UK government bonds. “They would have been wiped out,” said Kerrin Rosenberg, UK chief executive of Cardano Investment. The central bank said it would buy long-dated UK government bonds until October 14. Steep drops in bond prices may be signaling doom and gloom for the economy, but some analysts say short-term bonds are still looking more attractive than equities right now. “Record low yields have kept fixed income in the shadow of equities for decades,” said analysts at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in a research note. “But the aggressive shift in Fed policy is beginning to change this.” Central banks around the globe have responded to elevated inflation by hiking interest rates– and bond yields have increased alongside them. The two-year US Treasury bond is currently yielding nearly 4%. That’s still a relatively low return, but better than the S&P 500’s dividend yield of around 1.7%. “For the first time in several years, bonds are attractive investment options. In addition to providing diversification versus equities…you now get paid for owning them,” wrote Barry Ritholtz of Ritholtz Wealth Management on Wednesday. Consider the alternative: the S&P is down more than 20% year to date. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis releases its third estimate for Q2 GDP and US weekly jobless claims."
2022-10-05,CNN,What is Herschel Walker going to do now?,Chris Cillizza,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/herschel-walker-georgia-senate-what-comes-next/index.html," In the space of the last 48 hours, the Georgia Senate race was buffeted by two massive stories. First came a Daily Beast report that Walker had paid for a woman’s abortion after the two conceived a child while they were dating in 2009. CNN has not independently verified the allegations and Walker vehemently denied the report, insisting that it was a “defamatory lie.” Walker has been outspoken in his opposition to abortion throughout the campaign. Then Walker’s son, Christian, a conservative online influencer, posted a series of tweets that said Walker was something short of a model father. “I don’t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,” Christian Walker wrote. “But how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you’re some ‘moral, Christian, upright man.” Walker responded to his son this way: “I LOVE my son no matter what.” Christian Walker also posted a video on Twitter Tuesday morning in which he said he was done with his father’s “lies.” Those twin developments create deep uncertainty in the race between Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, which is widely seen as one of the most important (and closest) Senate contests in the country. So, what’s next? That’s hard to tell – mostly because we live in a post-Donald Trump world. Typically in situations like this, the candidate would do some sort of interview, usually with a friendly media outlet. That’s the route Walker took, sitting down for two interviews with Fox News since the story broke. The candidate’s campaign now has to do several things at once: 1) Try to reassure donors and voters that this is all overblown, and that the campaign remains laser-focused on what they need to do to win. 2) Ensure that there are no other shoes to drop – and that Walker’s total denial on the abortion charge can be made to stick. But, as if you needed a reminder, we are not in normal times. Just weeks before the 2016 presidential election, an “Access Hollywood” tape emerged that showed Trump speaking in lewd and crude terms about women and bragging about sexual assault. There was talk – publicly and privately – among Republican leaders at the time about him dropping out of the race or entirely disowning his candidacy. Neither happened. Trump dismissed the whole incident as “locker room talk” and went on to defeat Hillary Clinton. Which, even in retrospect, is a stunning turn of events. The question is whether Trump fundamentally rewrote the rules of political scandals in 2016 or if he is simply the very rare exception to this still-existing rule. Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise referenced the “Access Hollywood” episode in a speech to staff after the Walker news broke. “Trump still made it to the White House,” Paradise said, a source familiar with the remarks told CNN. (Paradise, via Twitter, denied making that comparison.) So far, Republicans are closing ranks around Walker. “Herschel Walker is being slandered and maligned by the Fake News Media and, obviously, the Democrats,” Trump said in a statement Tuesday. “They are trying to destroy a man who has true greatness in his future, just as he had athletic greatness in his past.” “Full speed ahead in Georgia,” said Steven Law, the president of Senate Leadership Fund, a major GOP super PAC focused on Senate races. The Republican support for Walker is, in some ways, forced upon the party. There are now less than five weeks left in the midterm election and dumping him as their candidate at this point – or distancing themselves from him – would almost certainly cost them a seat they badly need for the majority. It’s realpolitik at its finest. Of course, if more allegations come to light or if Walker looks so damaged that he can’t win, history suggests that the support he currently enjoys could erode quickly. The controversy surrounding Walker functions as a very interesting test case for how scandals will be handled by campaigns and processed by voters in the post-Trump era. Can Walker just keep campaigning as though nothing has changed? Or does he need a full plan to ensure he remains a viable candidate?"
2022-10-05,CNN,White House says Biden’s Saudi trip wasn’t a waste as he lambastes OPEC+’s ‘shortsighted’ decision to cut oil output,Kevin Liptak,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/biden-opec-oil/index.html," President Joe Biden is “disappointed” the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel agreed to cut output by 2 million barrels per day, the White House said Wednesday, as the threat of rising gas prices looms weeks ahead of critical midterm elections. The decision by the grouping of major oil producers rebuffed heavy lobbying from US administration officials and prompted Biden to say he was concerned about the move. It reversed a small increase in output OPEC+ announced shortly after Biden visited Saudi Arabia for a conference in July. Still, the White House insisted that visit was not a “waste of time,” even as it sharply criticized the decision to cut production. “The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” said two of Biden’s top aides, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, in a statement. “At a time when maintaining a global supply of energy is of paramount importance, this decision will have the most negative impact on lower- and middle-income countries that are already reeling from elevated energy prices,” the two advisers wrote. The administration will “consult with Congress on additional tools and authorities to reduce OPEC’s control over energy prices,” the statement read, without specifying which actions are under consideration dampen the oil cartel’s sway. Slashing oil production just ahead of November’s midterm elections poses a potential political problem for the President, who has touted this summer’s decreasing gas prices as he works to promote his agenda. The average gas price has been rising nationally again in recent days, according to AAA. Earlier this year, Biden announced a major release of barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to alleviate pump prices. On Tuesday, the White House said it was not considering additional releases beyond the 180 million previously announced. But after OPEC+ announced its decision on Wednesday, the White House said Biden would “continue to direct SPR releases as necessary,” apparently cracking open the door again to potential releases. Departing the White House on Wednesday, Biden said he was concerned about the possibility of a significant cut to production. “I need to see what the detail is. I am concerned, it is unnecessary,” he said in response to a question about the OPEC+ decision as he departed the White House for Florida, where he was set to tour storm damage. The international cartel of oil producers held a critical meeting Wednesday, where energy ministers decided to slash production by 2 million barrels per day, the biggest cut since the start of the pandemic. For the past several days, Biden’s senior-most energy, economic and foreign policy officials had been lobbying their foreign counterparts in Middle Eastern allied countries including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to vote against cutting oil production. When he visited Saudi Arabia in July, Biden sought to make clear it wasn’t solely to ask the oil-rich kingdom to increase its oil output. After decrying the regime’s human rights record as a candidate, Biden fist-bumped the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who US intelligence has said masterminded the murder of Saudi journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi. Speaking on Fox News shortly after the decision was announced, National Security Council communications coordinator John Kirby said the oil cartel was “adjusting back their numbers down a little bit” after making a small increase after Biden’s visit. “OPEC+ has been saying and telling the word they’re actually producing 3.5 million more barrels than they actually are. So in some ways this announced decrease really gets them back into more align with actual production,” Kirby said, noting there hadn’t yet been dramatic shifts in the price of oil. “We have to see how it plays out over the long term,” he said. Kirby said Biden’s visit to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for a regional conference “was not about oil.” “It was about larger national strategic and national interest goals throughout the region to try to foster more integrated cooperative region,” he said."
2022-10-05,CNN,OPEC announces the biggest cut to oil production since the start of the pandemic,Hanna Ziady,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/energy/opec-production-cuts/index.html," OPEC+ said Wednesday that it will slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day, the biggest cut since the start of the pandemic, in a move that threatens to push gasoline prices higher just weeks before US midterm elections. The group of major oil producers, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced the production cut following its first meeting in person since March 2020. The reduction is equivalent to about 2% of global oil demand. The price of Brent crude oil rose 1.5% to more than $93 a barrel on the news, adding to gains this week ahead of the gathering of oil ministers. US oil was up 1.7% at $88. The Biden administration criticized the OPEC+ decision in a statement on Wednesday, calling it “shortsighted” and saying that it will hurt low and middle-income countries already struggling with elevated energy prices the most. The production cuts will start in November, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies will meet again in December. In a statement, the group said the decision to cut production was made “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” Global oil prices, which soared in the first half of the year, have since dropped sharply on fears that a global recession will depress demand. Brent crude is down 20% since the end of June. The global benchmark hit a peak of $139 a barrel in March after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. OPEC and its allies, which control more than 40% of global oil production, are hoping to preempt a drop in demand for their barrels from a sharp economic slowdown in China, the United States and Europe. Western sanctions on Russian oil are also muddying the waters. Russia’s production has held up better than predicted, with supply being diverted to China and India. But the United States and Europe are now working on ways to implement a G7 agreement to cap the price of Russian crude exports to third countries. The oil cartel came under intense pressure from the White House ahead of its meeting in Vienna as President Biden tried to secure lower energy prices for US consumers. Senior Biden administration officials were lobbying their counterparts in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to vote against cutting oil production, according to officials. The prospect of a production cut was framed as a “total disaster” in draft talking points circulated by the White House to the Treasury Department on Monday, which CNN obtained. “It’s important everyone is aware of just how high the stakes are,” one US official said. With just a month to go before the critical midterm elections, US gasoline prices have begun to creep up again, posing a political risk the White House is desperately trying to avoid. Rising oil prices could mean inflation remains higher for longer, and add to pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates even more aggressively. But the impact of Wednesday’s cut, while a bullish signal for oil prices, may be limited as many smaller OPEC producers were struggling to meet previous production targets. “An announced cut of any volume is unlikely to be fully implemented by all countries, as the group already lags 3 million barrels per day behind its stated production ceiling,” Rystad Energy analyst Jorge Leon said in a note. Rystad Energy estimates that the global oil market will be oversupplied between now and the end of the year,   dampening the effect of production cuts on prices. — Alex Marquardt, Natasha Bertrand, Phil Mattingly, Mark Thompson and Betsy Klein contributed to this report."
2022-10-05,CNN,"Latino representation in media industry grew by only 1% in the past decade, a new report finds",Jalen Brown,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/latino-media-underrepresentation-goa-report-reaj/index.html," Latinos remain grossly underrepresented in the media industry and are significantly more likely to perform service roles, according to the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) newest report on Latino representation in film, television, and other publishing entities. The GAO’s 2021 study found that Latinos make up 12% of the media workforce and 4% of industry management, despite making up 18% of the overall U.S. workforce. This latest report, released on Wednesday, provides a more comprehensive data analysis of Latino representation in the media industry over the last decade and solutions federal agencies could take to help increase diversity in the industry. The population of Latinos in the media industry increased by 1% from 2010 to 2019, compared to the slightly larger 3% rise in representation across all other sectors, according to the report. “This invisibility means that Americans don’t know who Latinos are or how we have contributed to the success of our nation. This year’s report will be a call-to-action to achieve greater Latino representation in media and enable the Latino narrative to finally be part of the larger American narrative, ” said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, who led an effort in Congress to investigate the state of diversity in media. The findings released on Wednesday are part of the second installment of the GAO report. Last year, the agency released its first report, in which researchers analyzed Hispanic representation by media industry and by occupation. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus had asked the GAO to investigate the issue in 2020. The initial report, Castro said in a statement, “put a national spotlight on the industry’s failure to recruit and retain talented Latinos.” The media industry is responsible for informing the American public and influencing the way we think about the world and other people, which is why it’s essential for society to represent those diverse perspectives from top to bottom, the report said. Media companies also have a financial incentive to promote representative parity. A Nielsen report revealed last month that Latino viewers spent more time binging shows that included Latino representation behind and in front of the camera. When Latinos do obtain jobs in the media industry, they’re often segregated into service roles. 19% of Latinos who work in media are service workers compared to the 3% in senior management roles, the report said. Latinas have even starker disparities in industry representation. The only roles they have more representation than men are as news analysts/journalists and writers/authors, beating out men by only 1% in both sectors, according to the report. A small group of industry group researchers and representatives, union members, and Hispanic non-profit organization members identified in the report several different challenges that Latinos have obtaining jobs in the industry – like financial and educational barriers – but most of these stakeholders said that limited access to professional networks, in particular, had damaging effects. Some blame could also lie in how the federal government enforces anti-discrimination and equal employment opportunity rules, researchers say. The report provides recommendations that certain federal agencies could take to mitigate this disparity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sharing discrimination filing reports with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which can perform audits and drop penalties on companies previously flagged by the former agency."
2022-10-05,CNN,Crimean beauty queen fined by Russian authorities for singing patriotic Ukrainian song,Olga Voitovych,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/europe/miss-crimea-fined-ukrainian-song-intl/index.html," A Crimean beauty queen has been fined 40,000 Russian rubles (around $680) by occupying Russian authorities for singing the patriotic Ukrainian song “Chervona Kalyna,” according to Russian state media and pro-Russian regional authorities. Olga Valeeva, who was named Mrs Queen Beauty – Crimea 2022, was spared a jail sentence because she has children who are underage, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Monday. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Crimea said in a video that it identified a video online in which “two girls sang a song that is the battle anthem of an extremist organization.” It said that the pair were detained on suspicion of “committing illegal actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, as well as publicly displaying prohibited symbols.” They were subsequently found guilty by a court, the ministry said, and Valeeva’s friend was sentenced to 10 days detention. “Chervona Kalyna” is a patriotic Ukrainian song that has gone viral during Russia’s invasion, and rock band Pink Floyd has released a cover version. The lyrics urge the Ukrainian nation to rise up and “rejoice” like a red kalyna shrub (“chervona kalyna”) that is growing in a field. “In Crimea, no one is punished for normal Ukrainian songs,” said Oleg Kriuchkov, adviser to the Russian administration head of occupied Crimea, on Telegram Sunday. “But! No one will allow nationalist hymns to be sung here! If you want to sing ‘Chervona Kalyna’ or ‘Our father is Bandera…’ we will provide a platform – we will take you to neutral territory to Nikolaev or Zaporozhzhia. Sing all you want,” Kriuchkov added. The Ukrainian region of Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Since annexation, human rights observers have described Crimea’s descent into a police state, with local authorities and Russian security services persecuting and arresting those perceived to be loyal to Ukraine, including members of the Crimean Tatar community. A 2020 US State Department report described a pattern of “unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by Russia or Russia-led “authorities”; forced disappearances by Russia or Russia-led “authorities”; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment” in Crimea."
2022-10-05,CNN,Kourtney Kardashian says she’s not as close to Khloé as she once was,Marianne Garvey,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/entertainment/kourtney-kardashian-khlo-kardashian/index.html," For anyone who watches “The Kardashians,” sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian have always been tight. But now, Kourtney says, the two are in different places. “I think just life isn’t the same. I think I’m in a different place,” she said on the “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast. Kourtney Kardashian said Khloé and sister Kim Kardashian are now closer, because they have bonded over welcoming babies around the same time. “I just felt like they really bonded. They were going through the same things,” Kourtney said, adding that for a time she felt the two were ganging up on her. “That’s when I was unhappy with the show, partially ‘cause of (Khloé and Kim) kind of ganging up (on me). I felt like it was almost everything that Khloé and I had done to Kim, and then they were like kind of flipping it on me,” she said. The newlywed said they all love each other, though, and she’s still always in touch with her sisters. “I feel like Khloé and I are good. I spoke to her the whole time she was in Milan; we were FaceTiming. We FaceTimed on the way to school this morning, I saw her this morning at school. You know, we’re good,” she said. “I think just life isn’t the same. I think I’m in a different place.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,The perpetually youthful Adam Sandler talks getting older,Chloe Melas,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/entertainment/adam-sandler-interview/index.html," After three decades entertaining audiences, Adam Sandler somehow still seems ageless. But, now, age 56, the actor and comedian says he’s begun to reflect on his life and career. “I like my age, and it’s fun to play my age,” Sandler says in the latest issue of AARP. “It’s freeing. I don’t have to be true to anything other than what I look like and what I think and what I do in life. I’m nonstop commitment to my projects, though I don’t have the same discipline to keep my body in shape. There hasn’t been one movie where I’ve stayed the same weight throughout a three-month shoot. I used to worry about it. Now I’m okay.” Sandler became a household name on “Saturday Night Live” in the ’90s and has gone on to star in countless comedy classics from “The Wedding Singer” to “50 First Dates.” He says that when looking back on his career, especially his time on “SNL” from 1990 to 1995, he’s more self aware and has new appreciation for his colleagues. “I’m calmer than I used to be. I used to go nuts,” Sandler tells the publication. “I had a quick temper, quick reactions. I made a lot of dumb mistakes and said a lot of stupid things. Looking back on relationships, I could be an a**. I was selfish. I was competitive with other comedians and stuff. My father would say, ‘That guy’s funny,’ and I would say, ‘Hey, I’m funny, blah, blah,’ and he’d be, like, ‘Why can’t you both be funny?’ Because I was hungry, I didn’t always see clearly then.” Adding, “I’m also better at appreciation. I appreciate other people’s talent now rather than competing with it—in every field, in every sport, every part of showbiz. A lot of young comedians, a lot of the new cast on ‘SNL,’ they just make me laugh now.” Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions have achieved remarkable success over the years. Now he says he just wants to enjoy the ride. “I want people to continue to enjoy what I’m doing,” he says. “I hope they’ve had a good time with my movies, with what we’ve given them and, whether you’ve liked me or not, appreciate that I’ve tried my best … I’m just amazed people have trusted me as long as they have in this business and given me shot after shot. Because it would suck to do something else.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,Stocks slip modestly Wednesday following huge two-day surge,Paul R. La Monica,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html," Maybe that October market rally has some legs after all? Stocks pulled back ever so slightly Wednesday as a fresh batch of economic data revealed continued strength in the job market and America’s services sector. That’s led to new worries that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, meant to curb inflation, will eventually lead to a recession. The Dow was down only about 30 points, essentially flat, in midday trading Wednesday. The Dow had been down more than 400 points earlier and briefly slipped back below 30,000. That put a small dent into this week’s earlier gains. The Dow surged nearly 1,600 points over the course of Monday and Tuesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which also soared during the past two days, fell 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. Stocks popped earlier this week despite concerns about the financial health of global banking giant Credit Suisse                            (CS) and a drop in job openings in the United States. This bad news lifted Wall Street’s mood because investors bet that it could lead the Fed to slow its pace of rate hikes. Australia’s central bank raised rates by a smaller-than-expected amount as well this week, adding to hopes that global policymakers are starting to worry more about an economic slowdown than inflation. But that narrative shifted a bit Wednesday. Payroll processor ADP reported a bigger-than-expected increase in private sector jobs for September, a sign that American companies are still hiring at a solid pace. What’s more, the Institute for Supply Management reported Wednesday that its non-manufacturing index was higher than forecast. Activity did slow from August, but services companies still reported steady growth. The solid economic data is likely to keep the Fed on course to raise rates sharply in November and December … perhaps too sharply. There are growing concerns that the chances of a so-called monetary policy mistake are increasing and that the Fed will cause a recession. Rising energy prices could weigh on consumer sentiment — and the stock market — as well. OPEC announced production cuts Wednesday, news that lifted oil prices."
2022-10-05,CNN,Inside the White House’s failed effort to dissuade OPEC from cutting oil production to avoid a ‘total disaster’,"Alex Marquardt, Natasha Bertrand, Phil Mattingly",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/politics/white-house-lobby-opec-oil-production-cuts-gasoline-prices-midterms/index.html," The Biden administration launched a full-scale pressure campaign in a last-ditch effort to dissuade Middle Eastern allies from dramatically cutting oil production, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But that effort appears to have failed, following Wednesday’s crucial meeting of OPEC+, the international cartel of oil producers that, as expected, announced a significant cut to output in an effort to raise oil prices. That in turn will likely cause US gasoline prices to rise at a precarious time for the Biden administration, just five weeks before the midterm elections. On Wednesday morning, OPEC+ oil ministers meeting in Vienna agreed to an even larger production cut than the White House had feared — 2 million barrels per day, beginning in November, according to a readout of the meeting released on Wednesday. The ministers said the cuts were necessary “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” President Joe Biden told CNN’s Arlette Saenz on Wednesday that he was “concerned” about the cuts, which he viewed as “unnecessary.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters when asked about the move that “when it comes to OPEC, we’ve made clear our views to the OPEC members.” For the past several days, Biden’s senior-most energy, economic and foreign policy officials were enlisted to lobby their foreign counterparts in Middle Eastern allied countries including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to vote against cutting oil production. Wednesday’s production cut amounts to the largest cut since the beginning of the pandemic and could lead to a dramatic spike in oil prices. Some of the draft talking points circulated by the White House to the Treasury Department on Monday that were obtained by CNN framed the prospect of a production cut as a “total disaster” and warned that it could be taken as a “hostile act.” “It’s important everyone is aware of just how high the stakes are,” said a US official of what was framed as a broad administration effort that is expected to continue in the lead up to the Wednesday OPEC+ meeting. The White House is “having a spasm and panicking,” another US official said, describing this latest administration effort as “taking the gloves off.” According to a White House official, the talking points were being drafted and exchanged by staffers and not approved by White House leadership or used with foreign partners. In a statement to CNN, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said, “We’ve been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for consumers around the world and we will continue to talk with our partners about that.” For Biden, a dramatic cut in oil production could not come at a worse time. The administration has for months engaged in an intensive domestic and foreign policy effort to mitigate soaring energy prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That work appeared to pay off, with US gasoline prices falling for almost 100 days in a row. But with just a month to go before the critical midterm elections, US gasoline prices have begun to creep up again, posing a political risk the White House is desperately trying to avoid.  As US officials have moved to gauge potential domestic options to head off gradual increases over the last several weeks, the news of major OPEC+ action presents a particularly acute challenge. Watson, the NSC spokesperson declined to comment on the midterms, saying instead, “Thanks to the President’s efforts, energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump.” Amos Hochstein, Biden’s top energy envoy, played a leading role in the lobbying effort, which has been far more extensive than previously reported amid extreme concern in the White House over the potential cut. Hochstein, along with top national security official Brett McGurk and the administration’s special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking, traveled to Jeddah late last month to discuss a range of energy and security issues as a follow up to Biden’s high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia in July. Officials across the administration’s economic and foreign policy teams were also been involved with reaching out to OPEC governments as part of the latest effort to stave off a production cut. The White House asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to make the case personally to some Gulf state finance ministers, including from Kuwait and the UAE, and try to convince them that a production cut would be extremely damaging to the global economy. The US has argued that in the long-run a cut in oil production would create more downward pressure on prices – the opposite of what a significant cut would be designed to accomplish. Their logic is that “cutting right now would increase risks of inflation,” lead to higher interest rates and ultimately a greater risk of recession. “There is great political risk to your reputation and relations with the United States and the west if you move forward,” the White House draft talking points suggested Yellen communicate to her foreign counterparts. A senior US official acknowledged that the administration lobbied the Saudi-led coalition for weeks to try to convince them not to cut oil production. Wednesday’s production cut comes less than three months after President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a trip that was driven in part by a desire to convince Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, to increase oil production which would help bring down the then-skyrocketing gasoline prices. When OPEC+ agreed a few weeks later to a modest 100,000 barrel increase in production, critics argued Biden had gotten little in return. The trip was billed as a meeting with regional leaders about issues critical to US national security, including Iran, Israel and Yemen. It was criticized for its lack of results and for rehabbing the image of the crown prince who had been directly blamed by Biden for orchestrating the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. In the months leading up to the meeting, Biden’s top aides for the Middle East and energy, McGurk and Hochstein, shuttled between Washington and Saudi Arabia planning and coordinating the visit. One diplomatic official in the region described the US campaign to block production cuts as less of a hard sell, and more of an effort to underscore a critical international moment given the economic fragility and ongoing war in Ukraine. Though another source familiar with the discussions told CNN it was described by a diplomat from one of the countries approached as “desperate.” A source familiar with the outreach says a call was planned with the UAE but the effort was rebuffed by Kuwait. Kuwait’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Saudi Arabia’s. The UAE embassy declined to comment. Publicly, the White House has cautiously avoided weighing in on the possibility of a dramatic oil production cut. “We are not members of OPEC+, and so I don’t want to get ahead of what could potentially come out of that meeting,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday. The US focus, Jean-Pierre said, remains “taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy.” OPEC+ members are weighing a more dramatic cut due to what has been a precipitous decline in prices, which have dropped sharply to below $90 per barrel in recent months. Hanging over Wednesday’s OPEC+ meeting in Vienna will also be the looming oil price cap that European nations intend to impose on Russian oil exports as punishment for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many OPEC+ members, not only Russia, have expressed unhappiness with the prospect of a price cap because of the precedent it could set for consumers, rather than the market, to dictate the price of oil. Included in the White House talking points to Treasury was a US proposal that if OPEC+ decides against a cut this week the US will announce a buyback of up to 200 million barrels to refill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), an emergency stockpile of petroleum that the US has been tapping into this year to help lower oil prices. The administration has made it clear to OPEC+ for months, the senior US official said, that the US is willing to buy OPEC’s oil to replenish the SPR. The idea has been to convey to OPEC+ that the US “won’t leave them hanging dry” if they invest money in production, the official said, and therefore, that prices won’t collapse if global demand decreases."
2022-10-05,CNN,How a 12-foot skeleton became the hottest Halloween decoration around,AJ Willingham,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/skeleton-home-depot-skelly-halloween-decoration-trend-cec/index.html," There are two kinds of people: those who understand the allure of a 12-foot skeleton decoration, and those who have yet to understand the allure of a 12-foot skeleton decoration. Fall beckons the arrival of the Home Depot skeleton, a massive Halloween yard decoration that first hit the market in 2020 and has captivated imaginations ever since. Affectionately known as Skelly, the looming figure is now a mascot of sorts for those who delight in the gothic excesses of Halloween decor. Why so many people identify with this creature – enough to snatch up entire inventories in hours and spawn a whole skeleton black market in the process – is a question best left to a higher power. Perhaps Skelly is a bridge between the extremes of our human nature; sorrow and joy, famine and excess, the sacred and the profane encased together in high-density polyethylene. Or perhaps big skeletons are just funny to think about. “I mean, it’s the moment,” says Jenni Tabler, a sociology professor at the University of Wyoming. She summed up the zeitgeist in a now-viral tweet: “Happy enormous skeleton season to all who celebrate.” Tabler doesn’t have a Skelly herself, but she gets the hype. “I think for me as a sociologist, I find it very heartening that we can all rally over some of the small joys in life. And the enormous skeleton is one of those fascinating small joys.” Jill Troutman of Memphis, Tennessee, searched for two years before securing her Skelly. She had an inside contact at her local Home Depot, so when she got a call in September that the skeletons – the skeletons –  were back in stock, she raced to the store and swiftly snapped one up. Well, as swiftly as one can when the skeleton in question comes in a box the size of a Manhattan apartment. “The box was HUGE,” Troutman said. “I wasn’t sure I could get it in my small SUV, but I was going to die trying!” Several retailers like Costco and Lowes now offer their own Halloween behemoths, but the Skelly phenomenon started in the Home Depot offices in 2020. To hear Lance Allen, Home Depot’s senior merchant of holiday décor describe it, bringing Skelly to life was a labor of love. “What our holiday decoration team does is go out into the market, find inspiration, and see what we can do differently.” he tells CNN. ” We went to haunted houses to see what they were doing. We watched all the classic scary movies.” Ultimately, the team spotted a giant torso at a trade show, and the gears started turning. “We really brought the item to market at the perfect time,” he said. “It was during the first year of the pandemic, when everybody just needed to smile.” While the skeleton doesn’t have a name on the box, Allen says people around the office started calling him Skelly and, well, it fit. Allen’s teams know all about the culture their enormous brainchild has spawned, from the store sellouts to the undefinable charisma people find in his LED-illuminated eyes. In response to the Skelly success, Home Depot has added even more immense offerings: A giant pumpkin skeleton rolled out in 2021, as well as a 12-foot-tall levitating witch that was inspired by a floating street performer Allen saw near the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. This year, the retailer debuted a giant werewolf figure that, at 9-and-a-half feet tall, looks like it belongs on the 18th hole of the best putt-putt golf course in town. “What this is showing us is, customers are passionate about items that are larger than life,” he says. Skelly’s popularity presents a chicken-and-egg-type quandary: Does a 12-foot skeleton increase one’s fondness for Halloween decor, or does a fondness for Halloween decor increase one’s likelihood of owning a 12-foot-skeleton? It’s a little of both. Troutman, for instance, is giving her new skeleton (his name is Todd) a place of honor among her existing Halloween finery. “The whole neighborhood enjoys coming by and checking out our decorations,” she says. “I have to rethink the whole scheme because Todd is now the star of the show complete with his own special lighting.” When Vicky Euell and Glenn Grimstad of Toms River, New Jersey, got married last October, their household Skelly served as a wedding altar. “This is our favorite holiday, and everyone knows we don’t have a simple party. It has to be to the nines,” Euell told CNN. The couple’s holiday displays draw admirers from around the area, and last year they acquired the 12-foot Home Depot witch to add to their collection. (Euell, a woman of taste, also has a permanent witch-themed bathroom.) As Halloween passes, Euell and Grimstad have to contend with another critical phase of the Skelly experience: finding a place to store a 12-foot skeleton. “We actually decorate him through the fall, and leave him up through Christmas. Someone even made him a snow suit with a Santa hat.” “But it’s just for indoors,” Euell says.  “I don’t think he’d last outside in that.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,"90% of US adults say the United States is experiencing a mental health crisis, CNN/KFF poll finds",Deidre McPhillips,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html," An overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation. Nine out of 10 adults said ​they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults. The survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence. The broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends. “The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17. According to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors. More than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too. Major sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress. According to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019. “Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee. “People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.” Despite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues. But the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers. Experts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and  how to respond to mental health crises. “Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.” Nonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it. Nearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults. For those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey. In his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care. “Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March. According to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care. Through the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets. One significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before. But according to the new survey, there is still work to be done. The vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation. It also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services. Yet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline. “This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said. The fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults. The poll includes 1,603 adults who were surveyed online after being recruited using probability-based methods and 401 adults who were selected by random digit dialing and reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points."

The band announced on their verified Instagram account Tuesday that they would be postponing planned concerts in Brazil after frontman Chris Martin fell ill. “With deep regret, we’ve been forced to postpone our upcoming shows in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo until early 2023,” the statement read. “Due to a serious lung infection, Chris has been put under strict doctor’s orders to rest for the next three weeks.” According to the statement, the group is “working as fast as possible to lock in the new dates and will follow up with more information in the next few days.” “To everyone in Brazil who was looking forward to these concerts, we’re extremely sorry for any disappointment and inconvenience, and we’re so grateful for your understanding at this challenging time where we need to prioritise Chris’ health,” the statement read. Original tickets will be honored at the rescheduled shows."
2022-10-05,CNN,The world's best bars for 2022 have been revealed,Marnie Hunter,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-bars-2022/index.html," (CNN) — Move over London. Step aside New York. There's a new cosmopolitan cocktail capital: Barcelona is home to Paradiso, the newly crowned world's best bar. For the first time since the World's 50 Best Bars list was created in 2009, a bar outside of New York or London earned the No. 1 spot on the list. Paradiso, from owners Giacomo Giannotti and Margarita Sader, is a Mediterranean-style speakeasy, entered through the freezer door of a pastrami bar in Barcelona's trendy El Born district. The bar moved up from No. 3 in 2021. ""It's a big honor to win and a big responsibility. We will work hard to live up to being the best and stick to our principles. Our cocktails try to push creativity,"" Giannotti told 50 Best on Tuesday evening. ""But it comes down to hard work. The more you work, the more you discover and the more creative you can be. We will celebrate and then go back to the bar to do what we do."" The 50 Best winners were announced Tuesday evening in Barcelona, the first time the ceremony has been held outside of London. The vibrant city in Catalonia is home to three of the top 10 bars on the 2022 list. Sips was the ""highest climber"" this year, jumping from the No. 37 spot in 2021 to No. 3 this year. Two Schmucks came in at No. 7. Four bars in Spain made it into the top 50 -- Salmon Guru in Madrid was No. 15. Italy also made a strong showing in 2022's top 50, with bars in Rome, Florence, Milan and Naples all making the list. Newcomer L'Antiquario Napoli earned the No. 46 spot, putting the southern city of Naples into the top 50 for the first time. Florence also made its first appearance on the list as did Portugal's capital city, Lisbon. While London was toppled from the top spot, the city is still one of the world's premier cocktail destinations. Five London bars made the list, including The Connaught Bar, which dropped from its No. 1 ranking for two consecutive years, to No. 8 in 2022. London's Tayēr + Elementary, which awards ceremony host Mark Sansom said is ""one of the most original bars on the planet,"" held onto its No. 2 spot from 2021. Europe dominated with more top bars than any other region. The list is the result of votes from 650 bartenders and bar owners, drinks writers and cocktail experts. More big winners New York rebounded from a less dazzling showing than usual in 2021 to become the city with the most highly ranked bars on the 2022 list. New York is home to six top 50 bars, including Double Chicken Please at No. 6 and Katana Kitten at No. 9. Double Chicken Please won the Highest New Entry award for its strong debut. Sansom, who is content director of The World's 50 Best Bars, told CNN Travel the bar has ""an almost Michelin-grade kitchen,"" one example of a growing emphasis on food programs at the world's leading bars. In Singapore, No. 33 Manhattan also does ""seriously, seriously elevated bar food,"" Sansom said. Mexico City is another North American cocktail capital with four bars in the top 50, including No. 4 Licorería Limantour, winner of the Best Bar in North America award. Cartagena's Alquímico is the Best Bar in South America at No.10. There are three bars in Buenos Aires on the list as well as one in Lima. In Asia, Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong all had two bars in the top 50. At No. 12, Jigger & Pony in Singapore won the Best Bar in Asia award. Dubai had three bars in the top 50, including including No. 38 Zuma, the Best Bar in the Middle East and Africa winner for the third year in a row. In India, New Delhi's Sidecar jumped 21 places to No. 26. The Best Bar in Australasia is Maybe Sammy in Sydney at No. 29. The world's best bars for 2022 1. Paradiso, Barcelona (Winner: Best Bar in Europe) 2. Tayēr + Elementary, London 3. Sips, Barcelona (Winner: Highest Climber) 4.

Kumiko, Chicago For the full list of the top 50, visit the World's 50 Best Bars site. What visitors will find in bars right now With barhopping curbed by the pandemic, customers are more likely to linger in one place, Sansom said, and bars are offering more live entertainment in addition to upping their food programs to keep guests occupied for hours. And the lines between food and drink are blurring. ""The techniques and flavors associated with cooking and gastronomy are emerging in drinks and cocktail craft,"" Sansom said, citing New York's Double Chicken Please again. The bar's Back Room menu features an array of food-inspired cocktails -- from Waldorf Salad (whisky-based with apple, celery, ginger ale and walnut bitters) to Japanese Cold Noodle (rum-based with pineapple, cucumber, coconut, lime and sesame oil). Two Schmucks in Barcelona is also leaning on flavors associated with food. ""Its Curry Colada is one of the best cocktails I think I've ever drunk,"" Sansom said. Tools such as the centrifuge that made their way from science labs to restaurant kitchens in the past few decades have also appeared in craft cocktail bars in the past decade, he said. And custom glassware that sometimes inspires the drink rather than the other way around is increasingly important at many bars, including at world's best bar Paradiso. After the past couple of years, great hospitality is more important than ever, Sansom said. ""Post-pandemic, bars are a lot more aware of the value of each individual customer and making them feel wanted, safe, secure as they go into those environments.""

2022-10-05,CNN,The FBI released its crime report for 2021 - but it tells us less about the overall state of crime in the US than ever,Priya Krishnakumar,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/fbi-national-crime-report-2021-data/index.html," The FBI just released its 2021 Crime in the Nation Report, which is typically the most comprehensive snapshot of crime in the United States. But only 63% of the nation’s more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies submitted data for 2021 —  the lowest level of participation the FBI has reported since at least 1979. Only 52% of all agencies submitted a full year’s worth of data, the FBI said. A change in how the FBI requires agencies to report crimes in 2021 has led participation to plummet. Participation is voluntary and several of the biggest police departments in the country, including the LAPD and NYPD, did not submit any data at all to the FBI last year, according to the agency. The agencies that submitted at least partial data serve about 65% of the country’s population. The data collection system, called NIBRS (National Incident Based Reporting System), requires greater detail (and effort) in logging crimes, which the FBI said has lowered participation rates. As a result, the 2021 report relies heavily on estimates for their national figures. The new report estimates an overall decline in violent crime by 1% from 2020, driven largely by reductions in the robbery rate, which declined by 8.9%. The agency also reported a 4.3% increase in homicides between 2020 and 2021. NIBRS is intended to “provide more useful statistics to promote constructive discussion, measured planning, and informed policing,” according to its website. But it’s unclear how useful this latest release is given the record-low participation from local agencies — just a few weeks before the November midterm elections, where crime has become a dominating topic. “We are currently in a period in which there’s significant concern awith crime, and violent crime in particular,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist and professor at the University of Missouri–St. Louis. “So this is exactly the wrong time to be producing crime statistics that are so significantly based on estimates.” In 2015, the FBI announced that it was transitioning away from its previous data reporting system, the UCR Summary Reporting System (SRS), in favor of NIBRS-only data collection. SRS allowed agencies to aggregate monthly totals of eight categories of crime: murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, arson, motor vehicle theft, burglary and larceny. But NIBRS provides detailed reporting on dozens of different types of crimes. It gives greater context about each individual crime committed, including the relationship between the victim and the offender, the type of weapon used, the time of day the crime was committed or if the incident was cleared. Although NIBRS was first introduced in the 1980s, law enforcement agencies — from local police departments to county sheriff’s offices — could submit their data to the FBI using the simplified SRS until 2020. Many agencies have been slow to make the switch to NIBRS. While some have been using NIBRS to report their crime statistics to the FBI for decades, many have not. Many agencies have been slow to make the switch to NIBRS. While some have been using NIBRS to report their crime statistics to the FBI for decades, many have not. The 2021 report is the first year all agencies have been required to submit NIBRS data. When the transition was announced, the FBI estimated that they expected an initial participation rate of 75% — much higher than the actual 63% participation rate revealed in Wednesday’s report. The lack of comprehensive data — and monthslong delay between the end of the year and when the report is published — has led other organizations to fill in the gaps. The Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), a nonprofit that studies criminal justice policy, published a study in January analyzing 2021 crime trends across 27 major cities in the US. Their findings were similar to the FBI’s estimate: homicides rose by 5% and aggravated assault rose by 4% between 2020 and 2021, indicating that the steep increases in violent crime were leveling off. Analytics company AH Datalytics, which maintains an up-to-date survey of murders in every major US city with more than 100,000 residents, reported similar findings — a 5.7% increase between 2020 and 2021. But these groups have expressed concern about their role in informing the public. “I can think of no other system in American culture today where we accept this archaic data collection system,” said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of AH Datalytics. “It’s absurd that people have made private citizens to take it upon themselves to guesstimate what our national murder trend is.” The FBI has spent tens of millions of dollars training law enforcement agencies across the country on how to use this new system, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Readers can look up how much money their local law enforcement agency has received from the federal government to make the switch here. Several agencies appear to have received grant money, but did not report any NIBRS data to the FBI in 2021. There are many contributing factors to the low participation rates, Asher told CNN, ranging from technical challenges to low incentives to adapt to the new system. “There hasn’t been a lot of political pressure,” Asher said, citing the voluntary nature of the reporting as another one of the challenges. “You have to train your officers in new ways of doing things … it’s hard to overcome the momentum of a system that’s been around for 80 years or so.” In some of the country’s largest states, very few agencies reported last year’s data to the FBI. Only 2% of California’s more than 700 agencies reported any data to the FBI. In Florida, only two agencies reported data. It may be years until the share of agencies reporting with NIBRS catches up to pre-2021 participation levels, but data from 2022 does show improvement. By September this year, the FBI reported it had already received NIBRS data from 60% of law enforcement agencies across the country, indicating that next year’s report may be more robust. Last year’s UCR report saw a nearly 30% increase in homicides from 2019, the highest year-over-year increase recorded in FBI history. The alarming jump came during a year which saw a global pandemic, massive civil unrest following the police killing of George Floyd, and unique economic and social stressors. The 2021 report could have provided an essential look into the state of crime in a country emerging from a historic, tumultuous period. But while the NIBRS data does provide new details into certain crimes, the current nationwide picture remains unclear — especially because the FBI’s 2022 report will likely not be published until the end of 2023. However, other sources have indicated that the historic rise in crime the nation saw in 2020 has leveled off. While the FBI has only reported agency-level data from 2022, both CCJ and AH Datalytics have released national findings from this year. In its mid-year report, the CCJ found that across 29 major US cities, homicides had declined 2% from 2022, but aggravated assaults and robberies had increased by 4% and 19% respectively. AH Datalytics has reported a 4.5% decrease in murders across the cities it surveys. Until agency participation in NIBRS increases, the FBI may have to continue to rely on estimates for their national crime reports — but comprehensive, up-to-date data about crime in the United States is essential in setting policy, allocating police funding, and for informing the public, experts say. “Credible crime trend data is more important than it has been in 25 years — but now the numbers are at their most uncertain,” Adam Gelb, CEO of the CCJ, told CNN. “This [information] void allows speculation and manipulation, and further erodes trust and confidence in the justice system, and in government generally.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,REI dumps Black Friday — permanently,Parija Kavilanz,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/business/rei-black-friday/index.html," REI has quit Black Friday, forever. For the past seven years, the retailer has closed its doors on the day after Thanksgiving to give its employees a day off. The Seattle-based seller of outdoor clothing and gear said Tuesday that starting this year, every part of its business — all 178 stores, its distribution locations, call centers and headquarters — will close every year on Black Friday. The company said it would instead pay its 16,000 employees to spend time outside doing absolutely anything besides shopping that day. Although shoppers can still place an order on the company’s website on Black Friday, order processing and shipping won’t begin until the following day. REI first announced in 2015 that it would be bucking the Black Friday craze and keep its stores closed on one of the retail industry’s busiest shopping days, but until now it was a decision made year to year and not a permanent policy. At the time, though, it was an unprecedented move. Historically, Black Friday has marked the start of the annual holiday gift-buying marathon. It’s a day on which retailers have battled each other for shopper traffic by offering consumers the biggest and best “doorbuster” deals. But in recent years, the tide has shifted against Black Friday and it’s been losing relevance, especially among younger Millennial and Gen Z consumers who may not feel compelled to wake up at the crack of dawn the day after Thanksgiving to stand outside of stores hoping to grab a blender or flatscreen TV at 60% off. In addition, retailers aren’t necessarily saving their best holiday deals for that one day anymore, but rather are offering them even earlier.  Walmart                            (WMT), for example, is getting the ball rolling on its year-end holiday shopping season even before Halloween. Still, REI’s move to permanently dump Black Friday, as part of its “Opt Outside” movement to mark the day, is noteworthy because most retailers are continuing to keep their stores open. “Opt Outside has always been about prioritizing the experience of our employees, choosing the benefits of time outside over a day of consumption and sales,” REI CEO Eric Artz said in a statement. “When we first introduced this movement, it was considered revolutionary for a retail brand, but we felt it was the right thing to do for our members and employees.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,Russia concedes big losses in south as pro-Putin voices paint a grim picture of setbacks,"Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Mick Krever, Uliana Pavlova",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/europe/ukraine-conflict-russia-losses-intl/index.html," Russian forces appear to be buckling under growing pressure as Ukraine continues to regain territory in the south, where Russian soldiers have been forced to retreat from previously-held settlements as Kyiv progresses with its counteroffensive towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. A map used by the Russian Defense Ministry in its daily briefing on Tuesday confirmed significant Russian losses in Kherson – one of four Ukrainian regions Moscow is attempting to annex – compared to a map of the same area used in a ministry briefing a day before. The map confirms reports from Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials, as well as pro-Russian military analysts, of significant Ukrainian gains towards Kherson, down the western bank of the Dnieper River. Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, who spoke while the map was shown full-screen, did not mention the losses. However, he said that Russian military destroyed Ukrainian armor and killed Ukrainian forces in the area of several towns that are now understood to be under Ukrainian control – a tacit acknowledgment of Kyiv’s push. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the military for their “fast and powerful advances” in his Tuesday evening address, before celebrating that “dozens of settlements have already been liberated” this week. In Kherson region, he said that Liubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Biliaiivka, Ukraiinka, Velyka, Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid had all been reclaimed, “and this is not a complete list.” “Our warriors do not stop. And it is only a matter of time when we will expel the occupier from all our land,” the president added. Zelensky on Wednesday assembled his top military and security staff to consider plans for “further liberation of Ukrainian territories,” according to the readout of the meeting from the President’s office. Despite losing territory in the south to Ukrainian military at rapid pace, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday signed several laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Donetsk and Luhansk are both in eastern Ukraine, and fighting against Moscow-backed breakaway republics in each region has been raging since 2014. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February. The annexations are illegal under international law. World leaders have said they are the result of “sham” referendums that will never be recognized. Putin on Wednesday said he was “pleased” and “surprised” by the referendums’ results and before claimed that the regions will now be stabilized and developed while “helping strengthen the country as a whole.” The Russian leader added, “We always, despite the tragedy of today, have had great respect for the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian culture, and the Ukrainian language, literature, and so on.” Russia does not have full control of the regions it claims to have seized. In addition to Ukraine’s successes in the south, Kyiv’s forces made gains in Luhansk in the east with forces approaching the region from several directions, and over the weekend liberated the strategic city of Lyman, a key operational hub in Donetsk which the Russian army had used to funnel troops and supplies to the west and south. The Russian Defense Ministry said it was forced to cede Lyman or risk encirclement of its troops there, allowing Ukrainian forces to potentially use the city as a staging post to push troops further east. Asked by CNN how to interpret the language of the laws signed by Putin – which refers to the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as “the territory which existed on the day of its adoption in the Russian Federation” – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “I will leave this question unanswered.” When pressed to clarify by CNN, Peskov added: “You should read the decree; there is a legal wording there. On the whole, of course, we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of its adoption [as part of the Russian Federation].” The Russian-appointed deputy leader in the occupied Kherson region explained Ukraine’s rapid advance in recent days by saying that the Russian military was “regrouping.” “The Russian army is conducting maneuvers,” Kirill Stremousov told Russian state news RIA Novosti. “The regrouping of the front in the current conditions allows us to gather strength and strike.” The phrase “regrouping” was also used by the Russian Defense Ministry in September to describe the retreat of the Russian military in response to Ukraine’s offensive that recaptured the key city of Izium, in the Kharkiv region. Stremousov on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine’s advance had been stopped, and that it was “impossible” for them to enter the occupied city of Kherson. However, pro-Russian media has been uncommonly critical of the war effort in recent days, delivering gloomy reports that Russia’s campaign is suffering an operational crisis while Ukraine takes advantage on the battlefield. “In the Kherson region, we have lost 17 settlements,” Alexander Sladkov, a leading Russian war correspondent, conceded on state TV Tuesday, before placing the blame on “fat” US weapons deliveries and “intelligence gathered via satellite reconnaissance.” Sladkov is just one of several Russian correspondents to convey the losses Russia is suffering. Alexander Kots, a correspondent for pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, who is embedded with Russian forces in the occupied eastern city of Svatove, told his Telegram followers Wednesday that the military lacks the manpower necessary to hold off a further Ukrainian advance into the Luhansk region. “The Russian troops do not have enough manpower to stop the enemy attacks,” Kots said in a video. “The recent Russian losses are directly connected to that. It’s a very difficult period of time on the front line at the moment.” He said that “we expect a serious fighting here very soon,” and that “it remains to be seen if it could stop the enemy advances.” Kots confirmed that Russian forces were trying to fortify their defense at the line connecting the occupied cities of Kreminna and Svatova. Yuriy Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger said on Monday that Russian troops had withdrawn to the Zherebets River, which runs just west of Kreminna and Svatova. He said that Ukrainian forces are “on the high and enjoying a numeric advantage.” “They don’t have problems with the intelligence data or high-precision weapons which they are constantly using. We are just waiting for our reserves to become fighting fit and join the battle.” Meanwhile, state media reporter Evgeniy Poddubnyy, a correspondent for Russia 24, said Tuesday that “we’re going through the hardest time on the frontline” and that “for the time being it will become even harder.” Sladkov, for his part, tried to put a positive spin on things. “This doesn’t mean that we’ve collapsed like a house of cards. These mistakes aren’t gigantic strategic failures. We are still learning. I know this is hard to hear in our eighth month of the special operation. But we are reporters. We are waiting for reinforcements. Host Olga Skabeeva appeared visibly angry, before asking Sladkov if the entire Kherson region was in danger of being lost. “We don’t have enough troops at the moment to move on Kyiv or to quickly take Kharkiv, but they are sufficient to continue protecting the territories that we are already protecting,” he responded. “In straightening out our front line, we’ve had to retreat from these settlements.” He added: “It’s as painful as getting thumped on your melon. We’ve suffered losses. But it’s war. And these kinds of things happen in war. [Reinforcements] are coming, along with their equipment. I don’t lie or engage in propaganda. I’m just a regular reporter who is describing what is happening.” Sladkov’s admission on State TV was his second in less than a month, after he previously admitted that Russian forces had endured heavy losses on September 13, a Tuesday. At the beginning of this Tuesday’s interview, Sladkov quipped: “I only tell the truth on Tuesdays, and for other days I just make everything up.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,The battle of narratives on Iran is being fought on social media,"Abbas Al Lawati, Nadeen Ebrahim",https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/middleeast/social-media-disinformation-mime-intl/index.html," As anti-government protests enter their third week in Iran, the Islamic Republic has imposed a near total blackout of independent information coming out of the country. A fierce battle to control the narrative is now being fought online, where supporters and opponents of the government alike are taking to social media to tell their version of the truth and, in some cases, go beyond the truth. With access to Twitter blocked in Iran, that battle is primarily being fought outside the country. “It is normal for people to rush to social media when protests break out… It has happened in Iran and the Arab world,” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Qatar’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University who specializes in digital disinformation. “But the scale here seems quite substantial.” Protests aren’t new to Iran, and neither are internet blackouts. What’s changing, say experts, is the sophistication of those trying to get their message across. The protests started following the death of 22- year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the Islamic Republic’s “morality police,” sparking outrage among Iranians who took to the streets to demand more freedoms. A hashtag with her name has garnered 52 million tweets, said Jones, who has analyzed pro- and anti-regime activity on Twitter. Some of those tweets, he said, suggest there may be coordinated manipulation campaigns at play, possibly including bots. Bots are social media accounts controlled by software, not real people, that are designed to promote certain topics. He told CNN that an analysis of those tweeting the hashtags associated with the protests showed “a striking number of new accounts created” since the protests started. Of the 108,000 accounts in a sample using #OpIran, another hashtag associated with the protests, he found that around 13,000 were created in September, while the average number of accounts created per month in the sample was only 500.  Most of the September accounts were created in around 10 days following Amini’s death, he said. “It’s quite rare to see this amount of new online mobilization of accounts that then subsequent and continuously engage in tweet activity,” he said, adding that while this indicates manipulation, it isn’t conclusive evidence of it. Asked to comment on the matter, Twitter referred CNN to its policy of “taking robust and proactive action against violating content” where evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity is detected. The creation of new accounts “is a repeated hallmark of dis- and misinformation actors… [who] participate in the conversation to push a narrative,” said Steph Shample, a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute’s Cyber Program. Content from such accounts is not trustworthy, she said. Maziar Bahari, editor of IranWire, a pro-reform activist outlet, says there are many ways to verify content on social media, “but in a chaotic, angry situation it’s impossible to expect every member of the public to try and fact check, especially if those exaggerated reports have roots in the reality.” Bahari said there have been several cases of fake news successfully being portrayed as reality from both sides. “After every protest, the government shows confiscated firearms from archives or taken from common criminals and attributes it to their critics,” he told CNN. There are also cases of social media users exaggerating reports of killings and sexual violence by the security forces, he said. The harm comes “more when important public figures, such as politicians or educators, retweet the false narratives of controlling countries and their politicians,” said Shample. Any account on any social media platform that is successfully posting pro-Iranian government material while most of the country is cut off from those services is suspect, she said. “It is very, very dangerous to take things at face value anymore.” So, who’s behind all the Twitter activity around #MahsaAmini? Since Twitter is blocked in Iran, Jones suggests that the large Iranian diaspora may be mobilizing to keep her story alive, but other interests may also be at play. “We also know there are a number of people with stakes in trying to see regime change in Iran, from right-wing hawks in US and Israel, to the MeK,” he said, referring to Mujahideen-e-Khalq, an Albania-based Iranian dissident group. “The MeK certainly have been active in social media manipulation prior to the [death of] Mahsa Amini.” Shample suggests that the government itself could be behind some of the anti-regime tweets in an effort to track those who support the movement. The war of narratives between opposing parties on social media isn’t new. Twitter regularly removes accounts it says are tied to the Iranian government that engage in coordinated manipulation. Last year, Facebook removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to a troll farm in Albania that it said were linked to the MeK. The group was removed from the US terror list in 2012. Facebook describes troll farms as a “physical location where a collective of operators share computers and phones to jointly manage a pool of fake accounts as part of an influence operation.” Neither the MeK, which also goes by the name People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or the Iranian foreign ministry respondedto CNN’s requests for comment. The Iranian government has time and again blamed foreign conspiracies aimed at spreading false news about the situation in Iran. But Bahari says the disinformation and foreign exploitation of the protests don’t discredit a movement that has genuine demands for change. “Disinformation has existed as long as movements have existed,” he said. “But the advent of social media means that [it] can spread more quickly… when movements are popular and have roots in people’s aspirations for change, disinformation is just a nuisance.” OPEC+ agrees on a 2 million bpd cut in oil output, defying US pressure OPEC+ on Wednesday agreed on a 2 million barrel per day output cut, defying a pressure campaign by the US for the cartel not to make such a drastic reduction. The cut was the biggest since the Covid-19 pandemic and was twice as much as analysts had expected.

Egypt’s own Michael Jackson is making waves on social media. But this inadvertent pop star calls himself ‘Wegz of the poor,’ referring to an Egyptian rapper. A young Egyptian man from a modest family has shot to fame in the Arab world after unexpectedly reviving Michael Jackson’s legacy 13 years after the popstar’s death. His quirky Cairene touch had the video go viral across the region. In a short TikTok clip, Cairo resident Haytham Ahmed was seen imitating Michael Jackson’s performance in “Smooth Criminal,” mirroring his dance moves with hand gestures and an upbeat singing tune. Ahmed was filmed on the roof of what is reportedly a building in Cairo’s Sheraton district. Ahmed said in a TV interview that the video was filmed spontaneously early in the morning by his friend. Ahmed’s lyrics are barely comprehensible to English or Arabic speakers. Despite that, his passionate mimicking of Jackson proved popular. Hend Sabry, a renowned Egyptian actress, imitated Ahmed’s performance on her own Tiktok account, which got around 1.5 million views."
2022-10-05,CNN,Velma in new ‘Scooby Doo’ clip delights fans who say her LGBTQ+ identity has been confirmed,Lisa Respers France,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/entertainment/velma-scooby-doo-gay/index.html," It appears Velma wants a same-sex boo in the an upcoming HBO Max Scooby Doo Halloween movie. Clips from the animated special “Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!” have been making the rounds on social media, with folks using them to proclaim that the character is finally being shown as gay. “OMG LESBIAN VELMA FINALLY CANON CANON IN THE MOVIES LETS GOOOOOO,”one person tweeted, with a clip showing Velma getting googly-eyed over a female character named Coco Diablo. Other clips have also been circulating on social media, including one in which Velma tells fellow sleuth Daphne that she’s “crushing big time” and asking for advice on what to do. Fans have long believed Velma was part of the LGBTQ+ community. In 2020, director James Gunn said he tried to make the character “explicitly gay” in his script for the live-action “Scooby-Doo” movie. “In 2001 Velma was explicitly gay in my initial script” (for 2002’s live-action “Scooby-Doo”), he tweeted at the time. “But the studio just kept watering it down & watering it down, becoming ambiguous (the version shot), then nothing (the released version) & finally having a boyfriend (the sequel).” Gunn wrote both the 2001 live-action film and its 2004 sequel, which both starred Linda Cardellini as Velma. In the sequel, actor Seth Green played Velma’s boyfriend and there was nothing in the film to imply she was gay. Tony Cervone, supervising producer on the “Mystery Incorporated” series, posted on Instagram during 2020 Pride Month about Velma and the character Marcie in a photo that used Pride colors. “I obviously don’t represent every version of Velma Dinkley, but I am one of the key people that represents this one. We made our intentions as clear as we could ten years ago,” the caption read. “Most of our fans got it. To those that didn’t, I suggest you look closer.” CNN has reached out to Warner Bros., which like HBO Max, is owned by CNN’s parent company, for comment. “Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!” debuts on HBO Max on Oct. 16."
2022-10-05,CNN,Hurricane Sandy Fast Facts,Anonymous,https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/13/world/americas/hurricane-sandy-fast-facts/index.html," Here’s a look at Hurricane Sandy, which was also called “Superstorm Sandy.” According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard.

2022-10-05,CNN,Biden administration working to crack down on scams ahead of student loan forgiveness application process,Betsy Klein,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/politics/white-house-student-loan-borrowers-scam/index.html," The Biden administration is taking new steps to help protect borrowers from scams in the days before Americans can begin to apply for student loan forgiveness. Officials announced “ongoing and expanded efforts across the administration to combat scams and misinformation” on Wednesday, including “educating borrowers about how to protect themselves against scams and accelerating efforts to share scam complaints with states.” In August, President Joe Biden announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who are also Pell Grant recipients. The application process is set to kick off on a to-be-announced date this month, and officials promised that more information on when the application will roll out will be available “shortly.” When the process does begin, a senior administration official told reporters, borrowers “will be able to apply without having to upload any documents or inputting their FSA ID” through the application portal. But any program like this, however simple, can be vulnerable to scams, so there will be efforts in place to warn borrowers about bad actors. The administration is releasing a “student debt relief do’s and don’ts” document with guidance. Among the don’ts, the senior official said: “Don’t pay anyone who contacts you with promises of debt relief forgiveness. You will not need to pay anyone to obtain debt relief”; “Don’t reveal your FSA ID account information or password to anyone who contacts you. The Department of Education and your federal student loan servicer will never call or email you asking for this information”; and, “Don’t ever give personal or financial information to an unfamiliar caller. When in doubt, hang up and call your student loan servicer directly.” There will also be actions at the state level, including reports for states about scams in their jurisdictions. And the White House will work to coordinate between departments and agencies for a scam prevention effort, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Education Department’s inspector general, secretaries of state, state attorneys general and others. That will include a social media campaign and the FTC’s consumer sentinel complaint network where borrowers can report fraudulent activity via reportfraud.ftc.gov, among other efforts. An email sent to those who signed up for debt forgiveness updates last week preemptively warned about the possibility of scams. “You might be contacted by a company saying they will help you get loan discharge, forgiveness, cancellation, or debt relief for a fee. You never have to pay for help with your federal student aid. Make sure you work only with the US Department of Education and our loan servicers, and never reveal your personal information or account password to anyone,” it said."

After the game, Judge was asked if he got back the home run ball he hit. “Not yet,” he said. “I don’t know where it’s at. We’ll see what happens with that. It would be great to get it back, but that’s a souvenir for a fan. They made a great catch out there, and they got every right to it.” After breaking Roger Maris’ 61-year-old single-season American League home run record, Judge was congratulated by US President Joe Biden as well as former President Bill Clinton. “Congrats @TheJudge44 on home run 62. History made, more history to make,” Biden wrote on Twitter Tuesday. Clinton also tweeted Tuesday, “Congratulations @TheJudge44 on number 62! Thanks for giving baseball fans everywhere a thrilling season, and sending my best for October.”"
2022-10-05,CNN,Nia Long shares a tip for protecting mental health,Marianne Garvey,https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/entertainment/nia-long-ime-udoka/index.html," Nia Long is sharing some advice on setting boundaries. The actress took to Instagram on Tuesday, writing, “A tip for mental health. Learn to distinguish who deserves an explanation, who deserves one answer, and who deserves absolutely nothing.” Her post comes nearly two weeks after her fiancé Ime Udoka was suspended as head coach of the Boston Celtics after reports surfaced that the former professional basketball player was facing suspension for having an alleged consensual relationship with a member of the Celtics staff. The Celtics suspended him in an official statement on Twitter on Sept. 22. “The Boston Celtics announced today that the team has suspended Head Coach Ime Udoka for the 2022-23 season for violations of team policies,” the statement read. “A decision about his future with the Celtics beyond this season will be made at a later date. The suspension takes effect immediately.” Udoka told ESPN at the time, “I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family for letting them down.” Long and Udoka have been engaged since 2015. They share a son together."
